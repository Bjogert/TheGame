# TASK PLAN

_Last updated: 2025-10-13 (UTC). This file explains the step-by-step execution plan so humans can follow the flow easily. For day-to-day coordination between agents, see `.agent/tasks.yaml`._

---

## Step S0.1a - Confirm Toolchain & Baseline Run
**Goal:** Ensure the developer environment is ready before touching code.

- [x] Record the active Rust toolchain (`rustup show`) and confirm `rustfmt` + `clippy` components are installed.
- [x] Run `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo check --all-targets` to verify the scaffold compiles cleanly.
- [x] Launch `cargo run` to confirm the Bevy window opens without errors.
- [x] Capture outcomes (toolchain version, any hiccups) in `.agent/ai_memory.V.1.yaml` under the current step.
- **Outcome:** Stable toolchain `rustc 1.90.0 (1159e78c4 2025-09-14)` with `rustfmt` and `clippy` installed. `cargo run` launches successfully; CLI sessions must close the window manually or they will time out after ~5 minutes. WGPU prints expected warnings about missing Vulkan validation layers.
- **Exit criteria:** All commands succeed; initial behaviour is documented.

---

## Step S0.1b - Introduce CorePlugin & SimulationClock
**Goal:** Replace the bare `main.rs` with a modular core that manages time scaling.

- [x] Add `src/core/plugin.rs` implementing `CorePlugin`, a `SimulationClock` resource, and startup logging for sanity.
- [x] Adjust `src/main.rs` to register `CorePlugin` and keep the app compiling.
- [x] Consider whether Bevy's built-in `Time<Virtual>` satisfies requirements; document the decision in `ai_memory`.
- [x] Add a unit test or simple assertion (where feasible) ensuring `SimulationClock` applies the time-scale multiplier.
- **Outcome:** Custom `SimulationClock` resource wraps Bevy's `Time` to provide clamped, scaled deltas. Kept `set_time_scale` for future config usage, adding a non-test `allow(dead_code)` until wiring arrives. Unit tests confirm scaling and clamping. `CorePlugin` logs configured scale on startup.
- **Exit criteria:** App compiles and runs with the new plugin registered; behaviour mirrors the previous baseline.

---

## Step S0.1c - Add Debug Feature & Documentation Hooks
**Goal:** Provide diagnostic logging without polluting release builds.

- [x] Introduce a `core_debug` feature in `Cargo.toml`.
- [x] Gate a system that logs the scaled tick once per second behind `core_debug`.
- [x] Update relevant docs: `src/core/README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.agent/ai_memory.V.1.yaml`, and `.agent/tasks.yaml` (mark S0.1b done, S0.1c in progress).
- [x] Expose the feature in VS Code tasks (e.g., `cargo run --features core_debug`).
- **Outcome:** `core_debug` feature installs a repeating timer that logs simulation elapsed time, real vs. scaled deltas, and the current time-scale multiplier once per second. VS Code commands now forward `-- -D warnings` to Clippy and include feature-aware runs. Docs and planning artifacts capture the toggle and next steps.
- **Exit criteria:** Running with `--features core_debug` prints scaled tick logs; docs explain how to toggle the feature.

---

## Step S0.2a - Bootstrap World Shell
**Goal:** Create a simple world scene as groundwork for future systems.

- [x] Scaffold `src/world/` with modules for components, systems, and `WorldPlugin`.
- [x] Spawn a ground plane, directional light, and placeholder camera controller (keyboard + mouse) to inspect the scene.
- [x] Ensure assets/configs loaded are documented (e.g., primitives vs. GLTF placeholders).
- **Outcome:** `WorldPlugin` now spawns a 200Ã—200 plane, directional light, and a fly camera with WASD + Space/LShift movement and right-mouse look (cursor grab toggled automatically). Documentation covers usage and future follow-ups.
- **Exit criteria:** Running the app shows the simple environment and allows basic camera movement.

---

## Step S0.2b - WorldClock & Config Wiring
**Goal:** Make day/night pacing configurable.

- [x] Define a `WorldClock` resource that tracks time-of-day and season placeholders.
- [x] Introduce `/config/time.toml` (or similar) to load time-scale parameters at startup.
- [x] Update systems to consume `SimulationClock` + `WorldClock` to progress the environment.
- [x] Document configuration knobs in `docs/tech_notes.md` and `src/world/README.md`.
- **Outcome:** `WorldTimeSettings` now loads from `config/time.toml`, feeding `WorldClock` and the sun/ambient lighting system. Directional light rotation/intensity and ambient colors respond to the clock, and cursor grabbing uses the new `CursorOptions` path. Docs describe tuning knobs and defaults.
- **Exit criteria:** Adjusting config values changes the in-app day/night speed; documentation reflects the behaviour.

---

## Step S0.3a - Documentation & Automation Sweep
**Goal:** Keep knowledge in sync after the initial milestone.

- [x] Refresh README.md, docs/tech_notes.md, and .agent/docs/arch.md with the implemented systems.
- [x] Append a CHANGELOG.md entry summarising the whole S0 milestone.
- [x] Update .agent/ai_memory.V.1.yaml (promote durable lessons) and clean up .agent/tasks.yaml (mark completed steps, queue next ones).
- [x] Verify VS Code tasks cover new workflows (core debug run, world config reloads, etc.).
- **Outcome:** Docs now explain time configuration, architecture references the world clock pipeline, planning artifacts are aligned, and automation tasks remain accurate.
- **Exit criteria:** Documentation matches the current codebase; automation tasks feel ergonomic; milestone S0 ready for review.
---

## Step S1.1a - NPC Identity & Debug Spawner
**Goal:** Introduce a minimal NPC module with identity data and placeholder entities.

- [x] Create `src/npc/` module (components, plugin, systems) and register `NpcPlugin`.
- [x] Implement `Identity` component and ID generator resource.
- [x] Spawn placeholder NPCs with simple meshes positioned on the ground plane.
- [x] Document the NPC module and update CHANGELOG/planning artifacts.
- **Exit criteria:** Debug NPCs appear in the world with unique identities and documentation reflects the new module.

---

## Step S1.1b - NPC Schedule Scaffold
**Goal:** Introduce a stubbed daily schedule system and verify NPC activity transitions.

- [x] Design schedule data structures and determine how they tick (resource-driven via ScheduleTicker).
- [x] Implement a minimal schedule update system that logs activity changes.
- [ ] Add debug assertions/tests for schedule transitions (deferred).
- [x] Document schedule behaviour and update planning artifacts.
- **Outcome:** NPCs now transition between activities every ~5s of simulation time, and documentation/planning files reflect the scheduling scaffold.
- **Exit criteria:** NPC tick cadence is observable in logs and ready for future needs integration.

---

## Step S1.2 - Dialogue Scaffolding Research
**Overview:** Gather information about which AI chat services to consider, how fast they can talk, and what information they need from our villagers before we build anything.
**Goal:** Capture LLM provider options, rate limiting strategy, and prompt scaffolding requirements.

- [x] Enumerate managed vs. local LLM providers with pros/cons.
- [x] Define global/per-NPC rate limiting strategy and queue behaviour.
- [x] Draft prompt template and identify required simulation context.
- [x] Document findings in docs/dialogue_research.md and update project docs.
- **Outcome:** Research documented; README/tech notes updated, planning artifacts point to the upcoming dialogue broker prototype.
- **Exit criteria:** Dialogue research summary exists and informs implementation work.

---

## What Comes Next
S1.3 (Dialogue broker prototype) remains in progress so we can start delivering lines that reflect current simulation state. As soon as that scaffolding is stable, we will tackle S1.4 (Micro trade loop spike) to validate placeholder professions, goods hand-offs, and dialogue hooks against a tangible barter scenario.
